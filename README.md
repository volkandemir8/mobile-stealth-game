This is my first game project developed with Unity â€“ a simple 3D mobile stealth game. The player must collect all scattered points in the level to unlock an escape door. Once the door is open, reaching it will take the player to the next level (currently, only one level is implemented).

Enemies patrol between fixed points. If they spot the player, a detection meter begins to fill up. If the meter reaches 100%, the player is caught and the level restarts. The goal is to complete the level without getting detected.

This project was created to learn the basics of Unity, C#, and mobile game development.
